# Aspects
Aspects is a math-first astrology web app for people who don’t believe in astrology. This repo includes a Node API using Swiss Ephemeris to compute planetary positions and aspects, plus a simple web front end to display “receipts” and reflection prompts. Designed for skeptic friendly interpretation layers.
